I created those little tables you put in the pizza box so the cheese doesn’t get stuck
I spent my life working at the orphanage I grew up at, I’m happy it’s still going strong without me!
I died doing what I loved, being a firefighter.
I really enjoy cleaning graffiti with powerwashers! It’s very satisfying!
There's nothing more satisfying than rescuing a hurt baby bird and seeing them fly off healthy weeks later.
I had a great life, and I died how I always wanted, surrounded by family and loved ones.
I was just informed I picked up over 5 tons of trash during my life!
I loved spending time volunteering at the animal shelter!
Sometimes, I’d bring donuts and coffee for my co-workers to make their days better.
Sometimes, the best workout you can do is helping shovel other people's driveways.
